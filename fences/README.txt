--USING the mod--

This mod "overrides" the recipe for the default fence, so if you want craft a fance, it crafts THIS fence.

If you want replace already placed default fences open the "init.lua" (in this directory) and change
the first line to "local override_original = true". Then all placed default fences will be replaced with
this fence.

It is not possible to jump over the Fence or the closed Fencegate. Only exception is when you "sneak" and "jump".
